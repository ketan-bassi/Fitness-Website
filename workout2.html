<pre><h1><u>One Major</u> 
           <u>Muscle Group</u>
                          <u>Per Day</u>
</h1>In a one major muscle group per day workout split, bodybuilding workouts are designed in such a way that only one muscle group is targeted in each 
bodybuilding workout. This is a great way to train for very advanced bodybuilders who are significantly strong and can generate such a high level of 
intensity in each workout that training less frequently will allow for better results and recovery. Again, this routine should only be used by those 
bodybuilders who have spent years training using higher frequency splits such as the antagonistic muscles workout split.
<h2>ADVANTAGES</h2>
There are two advantages to this workout split:
1.It allows the advanced bodybuilder to just concentrate on the body part at hand and work it from all possible angles. At an advanced level, the goal 
is to not only build new muscle mass but also to correct any imbalances and achieve perfect symmetry (or harmony between body parts).
2.It allows the muscle to better recover from the high volume and intensity required from this advanced level of training.
Below you will find a good example of how I set up my personal one muscle group per day split. One thing that I love about this split is the fact that 
I can really specialize on my quad and hamstring training as there is one day dedicated to each of these body parts.


In this split, the whole body is worked over a period of six days:

TRAINING NOTES
1.Calves get trained on each leg day.
2.As a good rule of thumb, you can perform 20-25 sets for quads and hamstrings, and 15-20 sets for the chest, back, and shoulders. Calves, biceps, and 
triceps can be trained with 14-16 sets. Abs can be trained later in the day every other day for about 12 sets with cardiovascular exercise. More 
genetically gifted bodybuilders may be able to get away with more, but this amount works for most.
3.Advanced hardgainers are better off using a 3 day on, one day off protocol where each body part gets 8 days before it gets trained directly again. 
Also, they should limit the number of sets to 15-16 for quads and hamstrings, and 14 sets for the chest, back, and shoulders. Abs, calves, biceps, and 
triceps can be trained with 10-12 sets.
